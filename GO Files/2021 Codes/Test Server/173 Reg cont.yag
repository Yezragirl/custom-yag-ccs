Be warned, the dinos on our standard maps are max level 450, with increased damage and resistance. Be prepared before you transfer.**\n\nThe Community Center there can be found along the southern coast at approximately 85, 63.

Open the vault, and select **Reward Menu** from the center panel.\nThere you will find a starter package you can purchase for free. *You are limited to 1 starter package per Steam ID.*\nYou have your choice of glow pet, so if you don't like the one with the 1x next to it, just click on the 1, change it to 0, and find the one you'd like and change the 0 to 1. ***This is fully self-service!***\nOnce you've purchased your rewards, don't forget to remove them from the reward vault!\nYou'll need to **consume** the dinos to get them.
