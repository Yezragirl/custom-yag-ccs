"Description" "It seems that there are still issues with decay timers. In response to this, we have turned decay timers back off. This means bases of people who no longer play will remain until we clear them. That can cause unnecessary lag. To help combat this, admins will be doing map sweeps. To determine whether a tribe has been active or not, we will join the tribe and check the log. If no activity has taken place in the last 240 in game days (30 real life days) we will take that to mean the tribe is not active. Keeping your tribe active is as easy as cryoing a dino at each base once a month." }}

4.    Why is there an admin in my tribe
a.    It seems that there are still issues with decay timers. In response to this, we have turned decay timers back off. This means bases of people who no longer play will remain until we clear them. That can cause unnecessary lag. To help combat this, admins will be doing map sweeps. To determine whether a tribe has been active or not, we will join the tribe and check the log. If no activity has taken place in the last 240 in game days (30 real life days) we will take that to mean the tribe is not active. Keeping your tribe active is as easy as cryoing a dino at each base once a month.
