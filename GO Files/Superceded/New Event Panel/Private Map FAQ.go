-se -color "#000000" -title "How do I get a Private Map?" -desc "Private Maps are available as an add-on, to Sponsors of Legendary or Higher. In Patreon, when you select your Tier, there is a +1 Map, and a +2 Maps option for each eligible Tier. To get a map or 2, you select the appropriate sponsorship level. Once you have adjusted your Patreon, you can open a Map ticket using #make-a-ticket, which has a link to the Private Map Setup Form. Once you fill out the form, just let us know in that same ticket, and we will get it set up for you within 3 days."
-se -color "#000000" -title "What is the Benefit of having a Private Map?" -desc "1. You do not have to follow the standard building guides as you would on a public map. This means teleporter placements and having multiple teleporters to different resource spawns.
2. You can build as many bases as you would like and make them as aesthetically pleasing as you want.
3. Dino limits set to our public servers do not have to be followed on a private map. The biggest ones, like wyverns and stryders, can be left out in bunches if you so please.
4. You are free to gather resources and drop hunt without having to deal with competition.
5. You are able to name and passcode the map so that only select people you choose to share that info with can have access to that map.
6. While not all settings are editable, some are, such has day/night speed, dino spawns, PVP/PVE, Friendly Fire, etc.
7. You can breed in mass as you donâ€™t have to worry about bogging our public servers down.
8. These servers are still transferable unless otherwise stated. Which means that you can take players,dinos, and all normally transferable items in an out.
9. You can also have your store orders and such delivered straight to your map after you set up an admin drop off location."
-se -color "#000000" -title "What settings can I change?" -desc "The following options are available for you to select on a Private Map.
1. Map Name - Does not need to conform with the Yez's Standard Server Names. You can use anything you like as long as its not inappropriate.
2. Survival Evolved vs. Primitive Plus. (NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE)
3. Password - You set the server password, again, to anything that's not inappropriate.
4. Map - You choose which of the 11 maps you would like to use.
5. Event - You can choose which of the Wild Card holiday events is on your map. (Note: Not all of them work.)
6. PVE vs. PVP - You can choose to have a PVP map.
7. Max Tribe Members - You can have 1, 2, 5, or 10 Tribe Members per tribe.
8. Dino's On vs. Off - You can choose to have a map free of dinos entirely.
9. Friendly Fire - You can choose to turn friendly fire on.
10. Dino Spawns - You can add up to 2 non-native dinos to your map.
11. Boats - You can choose to increase the structures allowed on boats.
12. Day/Night Speed - You can adjust your day/night speed so night is faster or slower, or flip them entirely."
-se -color "#000000" -title "How often can I change the settings?" -desc "Settings can be changed once a month."
-se -color "#000000" -title "Can I get an all Max Level Dino map?" -desc "No. We pride ourselves on keeping this cluster fair, so any changes to private maps that would give any advantage on quests will not be allowed."
-se -color "#000000" -title "Can I get Arkmart orders delivered to my map?" -desc "As long as an active sponsorship is maintained, and an admin drop off location has been constructed, Arkmart orders can be delivered to a Private Map. If the sponsorship ends, orders will no longer be delivered to the map."
-se -color "#000000" -title "Can other people boost my map?" -desc "Yes they can."
-se -color "#000000" -title "What happens if I cancel my sponsorship?" -desc "Boosting will be turned off so no additional time can be added to the map.
No settings will be changed.
No Arkmart orders will be delivered to the map.
The map will stay up until it runs out of runtime.

*If you downgrade your sponsorship to no longer cover the map, but still maintain a Legendary or higher sponsorship, boosting will still be turned off, but you will still be able to make changes once a month, and have Arkmart order delivered until the map runs out of time."
